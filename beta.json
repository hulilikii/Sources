This option has no effect on a custom layout, or a physical game controller. \n• Better handling for 2 Player games, a 1 Player and a 2 Player Start option will be on the in-game menu. We try to detect how many Players, Inputs, and Coins the current game is looking for and try to adapt to that. \n• Downgrade controllers, if you are trying to use Controller 3 on a game that only takes 2 inputs, Controller 3 will be mapped to Player 1. \n• Controller Identify, when you hit MENU on a controller the Player number is displayed as the title of the in-game menu. \n• Supports Controler trigger buttons L2, R2. MENU+L2 will Insert a P2 COIN, and MENU+R2 will do a P2 START. \n• Removed separate Load State and Save State from the in-game menu, to make room, the menu is cramped in landscape and tvOS \n• 🅑 will exit a MAME menu. \n• Added support for HISTORY.DAT and MAMEINFO.DAT. you can import a .ZIP file containing the files or manualy copy files into dats directory.",
